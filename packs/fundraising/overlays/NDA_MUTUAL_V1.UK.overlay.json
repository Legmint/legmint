Key considerations: (1) Non-solicitation clauses must be reasonable under restraint of trade doctrine; (2) Injunctive relief governed by equitable principles; (3) Use 'made' instead of 'entered into'; (4) 'Registered office' instead of 'principal place of business'; (5) Authority confirmation recommended under Companies Act 2006.",

    "practice_notes": "Under English law, non-solicitation clauses will be scrutinized for reasonableness. Consider limiting to senior employees or those with whom the party had direct contact. Confidentiality obligations are generally enforceable if the information truly is confidential and the restrictions are reasonable."
