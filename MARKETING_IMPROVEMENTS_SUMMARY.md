## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### What Worked Well:
1. **Risk-based messaging** - Founders respond to pain avoidance
2. **Specific social proof** - YC, Accel, Stripe names > generic "startups"
3. **Cost comparison** - €99 vs €2,500 is more powerful than "affordable"
4. **Objection handling** - FAQs proactively address "will investors accept this?"

### Founder Psychology Insights:
- Founders fear **equity disputes** more than lack of documents
- They trust **investor validation** over lawyer endorsements
- They need **speed** (15 minutes) as much as cost savings
- They want **DIY + safety net** (templates + lawyer access)

### Conversion Tactics That Resonate:
- Live activity notifications (FOMO)
- Exit-intent with free value (not just discount)
- Comparison tables (makes decision easy)
- Multi-tier pricing (makes middle option attractive)

---
